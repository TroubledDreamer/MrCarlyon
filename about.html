        Hello, I'm Carlyon Jones-Armour, originally from Dominica and Trinidad. I find joy in programming, assisting others, and teaching, with a side interest in web design. With over 3 years of programming experience, I work with CSS, SQL, PHP, JavaScript, HTML, WordPress, React/React Native, Java, C, and Python. Additionally, I have familiarity with C+ and C#.

        <br>
        I hold an Associate Degree in Information Technology from CFBC College and currently serve as an Adjunct Laboratory Assistant at the University of the West Indies, concurrently participating in the Starapples AI seed program. My current focus revolves around expanding my skills in full-stack application development and AI.
        <br>

        As a current student at UWI, my aspiration is to become a software engineer, explore the world, and create cool projects.
